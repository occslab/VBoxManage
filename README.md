* Virtual Box Manage Utilities
 - VirtualBox by Oracle has an extremely powerful command line utility called VBoxManage. the only unfortunate part is that their documentation, while it does include everything you'd need for full control of the virtual machines, does not, however, have any sort of "setup" like instruction. Start -> Finish.
 -The things inside this git repository will be for fixing VMs, Building VMs, and Some small network tools with manage several VMs through Ansible. More documentation to come!
